# Alacritty 

Stripe doesn't allow the use of ghostty at work which means the only terminal
alternative is alacritty

## Downloading Alacritty
Alacritty doesn't want to go through the non-profit route and they also hate
apple so they won't pay for the 99 dollars per year to get their application
signed. As a result, the way to get alacritty on Mac is to get it from a cask
that has no-quarantine flag 
`brew install --cask alacritty --no-quarantine`
