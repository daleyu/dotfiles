# Git Internal Notes
For a long time I have been curious about git internals and the way that it
works and all the different commands. I plan to use this document to keep a note
of all the findings I have. I will work through this when I get more time.

Some notes I want to look into the specifics of are: 
- rebase internals
- detached head internals
- reset and soft reset internals
