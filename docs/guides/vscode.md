# VSCODE
Unfortunately it is very common at different companies that most if not all the
tooling is only built for VSCode and Jetbrains IDE's. As a result, I have VSCode
and Jetbrains setup so that they can match my workflow as much as possible.

## IMPORTANT OPTIMIZATION
- This line is needed in the settings.json or else vscode vim just basically
won't work
```json
  "extensions.experimental.affinity": {
    "vscodevim.vim": 1
  },
```

### Setting the settings and keybindings

I currently don't stow it, and I just copy paste it there...
This is so much less convenient than Jetbrains...

- I need to set up harpoon and some others still
