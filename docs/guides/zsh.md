# Zsh setup

I usually just get it through curl and then it should just automatically setup
and sync with my zshrc. 

- Currently looking into not using ohmyzsh and going more minimal but doesn't
seem worth it to me right now. 

```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
