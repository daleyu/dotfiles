# Fish Setup

Fish is the shell that I use on my personal computers. 

```
brew install fish 
```

- check the utils on the script to make fish default shell. 

I don't use omf because it is so bloated and honestly doesn't fit my needs. 
- Download fisher
```
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jorgebucaran/fisher/main/functions/fisher.fish | source && fisher install jorgebucaran/fisher
```

All my other plugins should be located in my dotfiles and I'll resolve any
issues I find when installing them next time I get a new computer.
