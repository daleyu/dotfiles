### Sketchybar
Because of the way aerospace and sketchybar interact, it is helpful to check a
few things as prereqs. 
- Make sure that each of the plugin scripts are executable
- Make sure that the application is in the `icon_map_fn.sh`

*Debug Script*
- There are some debug scripts in the plugins that helpful to check Aerospace's
  status and how it is sending data to sketchybar.
  Run something like `./debug_workspace.sh` to see the spaces that aerospace
is currently sending to sketchybar
